# PickNumbersFromHat
This code follows the structure of the question setting up. Use the enumeration way to analysis the possibility, total sum, mean, mode and varience.

I want to use this help me compare the influence of different n in hat(0)=[1,2,....,n]

However, because the enumeration has extremely low efficiency, the increasing of n will cause a huge increase in quantity of computation. Therefore, I recommand to test the code only from 2 to 8.
