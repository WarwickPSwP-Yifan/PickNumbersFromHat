# PickNumbersFromHat
This code follows the structure of the question setting up. Use the enumeration way to analysis the possibility, total sum, mean, mode and varience.

I want to use this help me compare the influence of different n in hat(0)=[1,2,....,n]

However, because the enumeration has extremely low efficiency, the increasing of n will cause a huge increase in quantity of computation. Therefore, I recommand to test the code only from 2 to 8.

I used the round sum replacing sum of all elements of the result to solve the problem of 'long time taking when calculating mean', therefore now it may takes time to enumerate conditions of n but it will come up with the mean quickly.
